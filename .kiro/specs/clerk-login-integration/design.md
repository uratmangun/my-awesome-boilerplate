# Clerk Login Integration Design

## Architecture Overview

The Clerk integration will be implemented as a frontend authentication layer that wraps the existing application components. The integration will use Clerk's React SDK to provide authentication functionality and UI components. Environment variables will be configured to support both local development and Cloudflare Pages deployment.

## Technical Approach

1. Install Clerk React SDK as a project dependency
2. Wrap the application with ClerkProvider at the root level
3. Implement conditional rendering logic based on authentication state
4. Add environment variable handling for both development and deployment contexts
5. Position UI components according to user requirements (top corners and below search input)

## Component Design

### Authentication Provider

- **Purpose**: Provide Clerk authentication context to the entire application
- **Dependencies**: Clerk React SDK, environment variables
- **Interface**: Wraps the entire application in main.tsx

### Sign In Button Component

- **Purpose**: Display authentication controls in the top right corner of the homepage
- **Dependencies**: Clerk React SDK, useAuth hook
- **Interface**: Renders either a Sign In button or user profile information based on authentication state

### Theme Toggle Component

- **Purpose**: Allow users to switch between light and dark themes
- **Dependencies**: Existing theme context
- **Interface**: Positioned in the top left corner of the homepage

### Add Project Button Component

- **Purpose**: Provide project management functionality for the specific user "uratmangun"
- **Dependencies**: Clerk React SDK, useAuth hook
- **Interface**: Conditionally rendered below the search input based on authentication state and username

## Data Flow

1. Application initializes and loads Clerk environment variables
2. ClerkProvider wraps the application and manages authentication state
3. Homepage components check authentication state using Clerk hooks
4. UI elements are rendered conditionally based on authentication status and username
5. During deployment, environment variables are passed to Cloudflare Pages workflow

## Technical Considerations

- Security: Ensure CLERK_SECRET_KEY is never exposed to the client
- Performance: Lazy load Clerk components to minimize initial bundle size
- Compatibility: Verify integration works with existing Vite configuration
- User Experience: Provide clear feedback during authentication flows
