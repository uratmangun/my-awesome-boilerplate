# Homepage Redesign Design

## Architecture Overview

The homepage redesign will modify the existing `HomePage` component in `src/components/HomePage.tsx` while preserving all routing and functionality. The component is rendered at the root path "/" by React Router in `App.tsx`. The design will maintain consistency with the existing theme system and UI components.

## Technical Approach

1. Update the hero section content with new title and description
2. Preserve existing Tailwind CSS styling patterns
3. Maintain the gradient text effect using the same color scheme
4. Keep the same card-based layout for feature sections
5. Ensure all theme-related classes work with both light and dark modes

## Component Design

### HomePage Component

- **Purpose**: Display the main landing page with a clear value proposition and feature access points
- **Dependencies**: 
  - ThemeProvider context for dark/light mode
  - React Router for navigation
  - UI components from `@/components/ui/*`
  - lucide-react icons
- **Interface**: 
  - No props required
  - Uses existing routing structure
  - Integrates with ThemeToggle component

## Data Flow

1. HomePage component mounts
2. Theme context is applied automatically
3. Static content is rendered (hero section, feature cards)
4. User interactions with buttons trigger navigation or external links

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: No additional API calls or data fetching required
- **Accessibility**: Maintain existing accessibility features of card components
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure proper display on all screen sizes using existing Tailwind classes
- **Theme Compatibility**: Test both light and dark theme modes with new content
- **Code Reusability**: Reuse existing UI components rather than creating new ones
