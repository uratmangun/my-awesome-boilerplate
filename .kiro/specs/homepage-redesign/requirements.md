# Homepage Redesign Requirements

## Introduction

The homepage needs to be redesigned to better reflect the project's value proposition with a cleaner, more modern hero section. The current implementation uses "Redis Boilerplate" as the title, which should be changed to "My Awesome Boilerplate" with a description that emphasizes speed of development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Update Hero Section Title

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see "My Awesome Boilerplate" as the main title on the homepage, so that I immediately understand the project's branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN the main title SHALL display "My Awesome Boilerplate"
2. WHEN the user switches between light and dark themes THEN the title gradient SHALL remain visible
3. WHEN the page is viewed on mobile devices THEN the title SHALL be properly responsive

### Requirement 2: Update Hero Section Description

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a clear value proposition in the hero description, so that I understand how this boilerplate helps me build projects faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN the description SHALL display "Use this boilerplate to build your project faster"
2. WHEN the user switches between light and dark themes THEN the description text SHALL remain readable
3. WHEN the page is viewed on mobile devices THEN the description SHALL wrap appropriately

### Requirement 3: Maintain Existing Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to retain all existing functionality on the homepage, so that I can still access the GitHub template creation and AI search features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the homepage THEN the GitHub template creation card SHALL be visible
2. WHEN the user views the homepage THEN the AI Semantic Search card SHALL be visible
3. WHEN the user clicks the "View Template Repository" button THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the GitHub repository
4. WHEN the user clicks the "Try AI Search" button THEN the user SHALL be navigated to the AI search page
